# Candy Analysis

Data science approach to the [Maven Halloween Challenge](https://mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-halloween-challenge/701f06a2-a19b-41e9-95d3-37a0dcc5492f):
1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in Python: [Candy Analysis](https://github.com/DozedCupboard/DozedCupboard/blob/main/Candy%20Analysis/analysis.ipynb)
2. Clustering in Tableau: [Candy Clusters.twbx]

### Goal
Using online votes ranking 85 types of candy, your task is to find the 3 treats you'll give out on Halloween to guarantee that trick-or-treaters of all tastes find something they'll love and present the data to back up your decision.

### My Approach
- View the data in Python
- Apply PCA to the data to create a scatter plot in Python
- Identify clusters and filter the data down to three candies in Tableau

### My Top Picks
- A popular candy: Reese's Peanut Butter Cup
- A popular chocolate option: Twix
- A popular fruity option: Starburst

These candy's were the highest in there groups after filtering for "winpercent" in tableu.
Resse's sweets are quite similiar to chocolate sweets so I picked the best between the two categories.
